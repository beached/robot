Code I had used to control a Roomba via a Raspberrry PI/Arduino and a web interface

Wrote this a few years back.  There is a web based control that would give commands to the Roomba via over a custom serial protocol to an Arduino that talked directly to the Roomba.  There was also a camera connected to the Raspberry PI that gave the user a view of what was coming.  It works/worked on an iPad and had the following commands available forward, back, left, right, spin left, spin right, enable/disable laser :)
